This python project allows for stock analytics to be collected from the r/WallStreetBets subreddit. We use 6000 ticker symbols and thousands of keywords derived from those companies to track the most popular companies that are trending on the subreddit.



Remember to invest wisely, and always stick to the fundamentals. I do not recommend using this tool for real investing.
