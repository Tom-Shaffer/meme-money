# meme-money
Python project which allows users to find what stocks are being talked about most on r/wallstreetbets.

DISCLAIMER: This program is not intended to be a serious investment tool. If you choose to use this tool to invest real money into real stocks, you do so at your own risk and I do not hold any liability on any losses you may have. The meme economy gives it's fair share of coin, but I am always a believer in the fundamentals.
